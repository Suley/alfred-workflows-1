# alfred-workflows
A small collection of basic workflows I've made for the Alfred app on OSX

I like to make life easier for myself so I've started creating some workflows and thought I would share them. They are free to use. Go make your life easier!

If you have 5 minutes also check out some of my articles at https://raddougall.com :)  < shameless plug

## INSTRUCTIONS
Most of these are install and go but some need special attention..

**Jira issue search**
You'll need to double click on the 'Open URL' action after you've installed the workflow and change [DOMAINHERE] to represent the domain of your Jira installation e.g. if you login at https://mycompany.atlassian.net you would use *mycompany* in place of *[DOMAINHERE]*
